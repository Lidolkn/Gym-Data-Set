# Problem Statement

## Objective
Fitness centers often struggle to identify patterns in member behavior that contribute to membership churn. This project aims to analyze gym member data to uncover:
1. **Workout Patterns**: Understand member engagement by workout frequency and intensity.
2. **Calorie Burn Insights**: Determine which workout routines yield the best results.
3. **Churn Prediction**: Identify members at risk of discontinuing their memberships.

## Approach
- **Data Collection**: Utilize the public dataset `gym_members_exercise_tracking.csv` sourced from Kaggle.
- **SQL Queries**: Apply structured analysis to segment and derive insights.
- **Visualization**: Create a Power BI dashboard to showcase trends and actionable insights.

## Outcomes
- Enhanced understanding of member behavior for fitness centers.
- Data-driven strategies for member retention and personalized fitness programs.
